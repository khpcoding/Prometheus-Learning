# Understanding Pushgateway in Prometheus
## **Introduction**

Pushgateway is a service provided by Prometheus for handling metrics from jobs that cannot be scraped directly. It's often used in environments where short-lived jobs need to push metrics to Prometheus. Unlike the standard Prometheus model where exporters expose metrics that Prometheus scrapes, Pushgateway allows jobs to push their metrics to it.

## **Use Case** 

Pushgateway is useful in scenarios where:

- Batch Jobs:
Jobs that run for a short duration and finish before Prometheus can scrape them.
- Job Results:
Collecting results from jobs that produce metrics but donâ€™t run continuously.
- Intermediate Metrics:
Metrics from jobs that are transient in nature and may not be available at scrape time.

## How It Works

1-Push Metrics:
Jobs push their metrics to Pushgateway.
2- Prometheus Scrapes:
Prometheus scrapes the metrics from Pushgateway.
3-Metrics Storage:
Metrics are stored in Prometheus and can be queried and visualized.
